# RandomForest_CreditCardApplication
## 1. Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
## 2. Use Random Forest to parse only important attributes for the model out of all the columns. These are the one that influences decision the most in successful credit card applications. Then apply XGBoost with K-fold Cross Validation to build a model to predict succesful credit card applications. Use the hyperparameter values as needed for formulation of the model.
